I'm an archivist, writer, and researcher committed to reimagining dominant systems, standards, and practices to decentralize expertise and advocate for the epistemic autonomy of historically underrepresented communities. At the heart of my practice is a deep committment to liberatory memory work and an awareness of the power structures that shape the production and circulation of knowledge over time. As an activist archivist, I am driven by the potential of archival storytelling to advance decolonization, abolitionism, placekeeping, and mutual aid. My work is shaped by the legacies of fugitive information workers, oral historians, activists, and community builders who put themselves at risk to preserve and amplify alternative ways of knowing and being.

I received my MLIS from UCLA in 2023, where I specialized in community archiving and reparative metadata. My writing and research have been published and presented in a variety of venues including the _Urban Library Journal_ and the American Library Association's Social Responsibilities Roundtable (SRRT). Throughout my career, I have contributed to data-driven, participatory, and place-based memory work at the Skid Row History Museum & Archive, Getty Research Institute, Fowler Museum at UCLA, and Clyfford Still Museum.
